# portfolio-challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to test our current knowledge of HTML and CSS by requiring us to build our own webpage from scratch.  For this work, it was essential for us to properly set up our development environment (workflow) and plan the layout of the webpage (wireframing).  Because this webpage would represent our portfoilio, it was also important that we created a responsive design so that potential employers may view our work from their phone or other smaller screens.

While this task may have seemed daunting at first, I found plenty of enjoyment simply playing around with the code and figuring out possibilities and functionalities. There were many points during this challenge where experimentation with different properties and values taught me how something really worked. I also learned a lot by running into problems and figuring out solutions. The following is a list of observations I made in my troubleshooting process:

- While setting up the HTML format and corresponding CSS rules, it is important to be concise. It is easier to deal with issues when there is less code to review.
- When faced with a multitude of issues, focus on them one at a time, and go even further by making changes to the code one at a time. While that might sound time-consuming, this kept my diagnosis organized and also helped me learn more.
- Google is an incredible resource.
- Chrome DevTools was especially useful for experimenting because it automatically updates your page. It is much better than constantly changing your file and refreshing your page.
- The best lessons were learned when the errors were more difficult to correct.

What I really liked about this challenge was the freedom to represent myself through my work. The process of envisioning something and then turning it into reality was quite fulfilling.

The biggest problem I faced with this project was making sure that my page adapted to various screen sizes.

Overall, I found this challenge quite helpful in establishing my basic skills.
