# portfolio-challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to test our current knowledge of HTML and CSS by requiring us to build our own webpage from scratch.  For this work, it was essential for us to properly set up our development environment (workflow) and plan the layout of the webpage (wireframing).  Because this webpage would represent our portfoilio, it was also important that we create a responsive design so that potential employers may view our work from their phone or other smaller screens.

The following is a list of observations and lessons I learned through this challenge:

- While setting up the HTML format and corresponding CSS rules, I realized the important of being concise. It is easier to deal with issues when there is less code to review.
- Speaking of issues, it is efficient to handle problems one at a time by making changes to the code one at a time. While that might sound time-consuming, this kept my diagnosis organized and also helped me learn more.
- Google is an incredible resource for troubleshooting.
- Chrome DevTools was especially useful when trying to make smaller changes. It is much better than constantly updating your file and refreshing your page.
- The biggest problem I faced with this project was making sure that my page adapted to various screen sizes.
- The best lessons were learned when the errors were more difficult to correct.

While this task may have seemed daunting at first, I found plenty of enjoyment simply playing around with the code and figuring out possibilities and functionalities. Furthermore, due to the nature of our task, I tried to represent myself as best as I could through the work. Overall, I found this challenge quite helpful in establishing my skills and to be fulfilling.
